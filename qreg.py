    """
    Estimates quantile regression coefficients for given data and quantiles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    Y : numpy.ndarray of shape (N,)
        response variable sample of length N
    K : numpy.ndarray with shape (N, K), or (N,) if K = 1
        N samples of K independent variables used to explain Y
    tau: array like
        list of Ntau quantiles for which to estimate linear model coefficients

    Returns
    -------
    beta : numpy.ndarray of shape (Ntau, K + 1)
        array of length Ntau where i-th row has the linear model coefficients
        corresponding to the i-th quantile in the input array `tau`

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError : error
                    quantiles are not provided
    AssertionError : error
                    length of sample sizes in X and Y are unequal

    Notes
    -----
    a) As of now, the only documentation is the one in this help text for the
    `linear` function. However, the formulation of the linear program in the
    function is based on the description provided in [1]. More detailed
    documentation based on this will come soon.
    b) Normal minimization using the cost function formulated by Koenker along
    with the scipy.optimize.minimize function does not converge and does not
    give the correct result.
