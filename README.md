# qreg
Python module to carry out quantile regression

This module can be used to estimate linear regression coefficients for
different quantiles for a give data set.


# Installation

1. Simply clone this repository and copy ``qreg.py`` in the directory
   where you are working in.

2. Alternatively, you can clone this repository to a desired directory
   of your choice and then create and Python startup file
   ``.pythonstartup`` in your home directory as:

```python
import sys
import os
home = os.path.expanduser("~")
sys.path.append(home + "/<path_to_package>")
```

Save the file, and that's it! From then on, all python shells should be
able to detect (and import) the ``qreg`` package without any problem.

# Documentation

Detailed documentation to some soon. For now, the help text of the
``qreg.linear`` function should suffice.


# Examples

An example script ``example.py`` is included in the repository.
